# Rock, Paper, Scissors
 
Creating a rock, paper, scissors game in a different programming language...
everyday... for all of eternity.

## Resources

Before we get started, special thanks to the following:

- http://rosettacode.org/
- https://esolangs.org/
- http://stackoverflow.com/

## Dear God, Why?

Because learning. S'why.

### But... Why Rock, Paper, Scissors?

Hello world is boring.

Fizz buzz is played out.

Rock, Paper, Scissors, on the other hand, has a little bit of everything,
making it a perfect learning opportunity for developers at any level. Typical
features include:

- Loops
- Input
- Validation
- Output
- Randomization
- Conditionals

## Contributing

Want to contribute to our little project? Take a look at some of our existing
examples, take a crack at any language, and submit a pull request.

We are by no means experts, so if you see something that can be improved upon,
please let us know (or submit a pull request with the changes yourself)!

### Functionality

We haven't exactly established many rules, but here are some guidelines that we
are trying to adhere pretty strictly to with each implementation:

- The game should continue until either the player or the computer wins. That
  means an infinite loop.
- In command line applications, unless explicitly impossible due to language
  constraints, the user input dialog should be inline with input prompt.
- Unless it is absolutely, 100% necessary, do not use third party libraries or
  packages. Try to use standard libraries whenever possible.

### README

Every language should have a README file explaining (or at least pointing to
a resource explaining) how to install, compile, and run the source.
